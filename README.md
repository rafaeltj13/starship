# Starship - Web Engineering Project

This project was created with the pourpose of exploring new ideas for itergalatic ambitions, together with the partner we decided to create a starship list to easily find all the ships available, and also our favorites.

To build the project, I've decided to go with modern frameworks and libraries already thinking in the possibility to add new features, or maybe upgrade and improve the existing ones:

- Vue 3
- TypeScript
- Vite
- TailwindCSS
