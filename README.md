# Starship - Web Engineering Project

This project was created with the pourpose of exploring new ideas for itergalatic ambitions, together with the partner we decided to create a starship list to easily find all the ships available, and also our favorites.

To build the project, I've decided to go with modern frameworks and libraries already thinking in the possibility to add new features, or maybe upgrade and improve the existing ones:

- Vue 3
- TypeScript
- Vite
- TailwindCSS
- Pinia

# Features

## 1. Starship list

In the home route("/") we have the funcionality to list all the available starship with some interesting data related to each ship, including:

- Name;
- Manufacturer;
- Rating;
- Passengers,

We also have the possibility to add each ship to the favorite list.

## 2. Favorites

In the favorite route("/favorites") we have the funcionality to list our favorite starships. Also, in that view we have the possibility to add some notes to each indivual ship and that information in saving while you navigate on the app.
